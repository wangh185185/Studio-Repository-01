    <p>There are many common triggers for anger, such as losing your patience, 
        feeling as if your opinion or efforts aren't appreciated, and injustice. Other causes of anger include memories of traumatic or enraging events and worrying about personal problems. ... Your personal history feeds your reactions to anger, too.
